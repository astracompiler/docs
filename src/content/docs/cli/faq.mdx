## "Exe is too heavy!"
It really is? The average capacity of a modern hard drive is 512GB, so the 80 MB application doesn't seem that heavy.

Also, keep in mind that you get all node.js features, including npm packages.

In my opinion, it's a good trade-off.

## "That's not a compiler, that's a bundler!"
I know, astra doesn’t do register allocation or full parsing, so strictly speaking, it’s not a compiler in the traditional sense.
I used the term “compiler” because for many developers, it’s strongly associated with “turning source code into a single binary.” That’s what Astra does at a practical level — even if it's technically just bundling and embedding into a Node executable using SEA and postject.
