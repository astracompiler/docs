## astra versions
Check available Node.js versions for compilation.

Astra can compile only specific versions of Node.js (>20.0.0).
This command will show you the list of available versions.

### Usage
```bash
astra versions
```

## astra install
Preinstall Node.js on the target machine. 

Astra needs a preinstalled node.exe in cache to compile your code.

You can preinstall version of your choice with this command and never install it again.

Useful when you are working offline.

### Usage
```bash
astra install [version (optional)]
```

## astra build
Compile your code to an executable.

### Usage
```bash
astra build [entry] ...args
```
### Args
If you want build creator do not pass any arguments.
You have to pass all arguments or none of them.
- `-o --outDir` - Output directory for the executable.
- `-n --node` - Node.js version to compile with. (in astra format eg. node_20.0.0_win_x64)
- `--disShasumCheck` - Disable shasum check for node.exe. This will skip validation process of node.exe binary. (only enable if you know what you are doing!!)
