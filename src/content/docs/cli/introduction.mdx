## What's Astra?
Astra is a windows js to exe compiler. 
It's compiles your javascript code to a standalone executable file.

## Use Cases
- Make a commercial application without source code.
- Use your node.js application on a machine without node.js installed.
- For apps like installers, updaters, etc.
- Make a trial/demo version of your application.

## Everything you have to know
- Astra is compiling to windows only for now. (working on macOS and linux)
- Astra is using Node SEA (Single Executable Applications) to compile your code. It's still an experimental feaurte and things may crash unexpectedly.
- Average size of the executable is around 70~80 MB. (depends on your code)

## Unsupported depencencies (to have used in your code)
- esbuild
- bcrypt
- sharp
- sqlite3
- better-sqlite3
- canvas
- serialport
- ffi-napi
- @node-rs/bcrypt
- keytar
- robotjs
- node-notifier
- puppeteer
- playwright
- cypress
- node-sass (deprecated)
- edge-js

And other using native solutions (`.h`, `.node`, `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.exe`) or native modules.

### But... why?
Astra uses esbuild to bundle your code.
esbuild is a great bundler, but it doesn't support native modules and leaves them unbundled (external).

## Why Astra?
Astra is designed to build standalone executables effortlessly.
I wanted simple tool to compile my source code to exe without any hassle, and I couldn't find one.
So, I built one.

## Why... not?
### [nexe](https://npmjs.com/package/nexe)
Nexe is a great tool, but it's not as simple as Astra. 
- it's biggest cons is that it's not supporting latest vesions of node.js.
- poorly supprots esm.

#### Use it instead of Astra if:
- You are using older version of node.js and have cjs project

### [pkg](https://npmjs.com/package/pkg)
pkg is a great tool, i used it for a long time.
- it's biggest cons is it generates heavy executables.
- it's not supporting esm.

#### Use it instead of Astra if:
- You are not concerned about the size of the executable.
- You are not using esm.
- You are using older version of node.js.

# Under the hood
Astra uses native method of compilation called [Node SEA](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html) (Single Executable Applications) to compile your source code to exe.
Astra is wrapper around Node SEA, with some additional features.
Astra injects your code into node.exe file with [postject](https://npmjs.com/package/postject).

For bundling, Astra uses [esbuild](https://npmjs.com/package/esbuild). It's the best bundler out on npm.

For editing icon and metadata, Astra uses [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit).
